# resilience4ts

`resilience4ts` is a package that provides ergonomic tools for building performant and safe distributed systems in Typescript. Unlike existing Typescript ports of Java libraries like Hystrix and resilience4j, or .NET packages like Polly, it is designed to be used specifically in highly-concurrent, distributed applications.
